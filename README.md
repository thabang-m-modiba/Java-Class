### Classes, Types and Objects
* In Java, <b>Classes</b> act as blueprints for creating <b>Objects</b>.
* An <b>Object</b> is an instance of a class.
* <b>Type</b> refers to the classification that a variable can hold. We have Primitive Types and Reference Types.
   * Primitive Types includes <code>int</code>, <code>boolean</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>double</code>.
   * Reference Types are types that refer to Objects, including classes, interfaces, and arrays.


 #### Declaring a Class
 * To declare a Class means to define the blueprint that describes how an Object will look like and how it will behave.
 * Example of a Class named Car:

<code>public class Student{
    private int studentNo;
}</code>
